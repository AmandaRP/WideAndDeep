## Application

Wine price prediction given rating review text and wine variety. R Keras model in [wine-model.R](https://github.com/AmandaRP/WideAndDeep/blob/master/wine-model.R). Mostly follows layout described in [this TensorFlow blog post](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2018/04/predicting-price-of-wine-with-keras-api-tensorflow.html).
